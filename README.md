I will oversee the design and implementation of the front-end spectrum of the application, leveraging my skillset and experience in web development and angular application development. As someone who is skilled in artistic expression such as sketching, drawing, and painting, I excel in areas of front-end design. Additionally, I possess expertise in architecture and pattern design, as well as experience assisting in DevOps.

In addition to my technical skills, I also take up the role of project manager, ensuring effective coordination between all members. My past experiences working on many group projects with my team members have equipped me with the necessary skills to deliver quality results on time. It is worth mentioning that I am also skilled in UI/UX design, which will be valuable in designing user-friendly interfaces for the application.

<p>
Morgan will be responsible for the backend Services, integration, and testing of the application. With a background in engineering, he has a solid understanding of engineering principles. Additionally, he has experience in testing and integration with NestJS. Having proficient skills in data structures and algorithms as well as engineering mathematics, he has a good eye for algorithmic flaws, and noticing finer details many programmers would not immediately see. He is thus ideal for backend Services as he can guarantee quality testing, algorithm efficiency and a high quality of backend services.
