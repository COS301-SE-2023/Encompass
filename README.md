I will be responsible for the backend Services, integration, and testing of the application. With a background in engineering, I have a solid understanding of engineering principles. Additionally, I have experience in testing and integration with NestJS. Having proficient skills in data structures and algorithms as well as engineering mathematics, I have a good eye for algorithmic flaws, and noticing finer details many programmers would not immediately see. I am thus ideal for backend Services as I can guarantee quality testing, algorithm efficiency and a high quality of backend services.
