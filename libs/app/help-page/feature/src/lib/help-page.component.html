            <br />
            <br />
            This challenge you described is what you want your community
            followers to do in preparation for the quiz, so be specific and
            clear.

            You can then add tasks for your community members to complete.
            These tasks can be anything from reading an article to watching a
            video, and you can add as many as you want. You can also add a due
            date for the event.
            <br />
            <br />
            For the quiz you must enter 3 keywords for the AI to generate a
            relavant quiz, so be sure to use words that are relavant to the
            challenge you described. Examples would be: "South America",
            "Amazon River", "Animals".
            <br />
            <br />
            You can then choose the amount of questions you want your quiz to
            have. If you cannot create the event, this means you are missing
            some information - so check if you've added both a title and at
            least one task.
